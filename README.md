# Deepfake Detection Tool

This project aims to develop a robust deepfake detection solution that enhances the integrity of digital media and combats misinformation. By analyzing images and videos for deepfake indicators, the tool identifies manipulated media and generates a confidence score. It uses advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing, with plans to extend support to video streams. Future improvements include a user-friendly interface, real-time detection, and secure media processing.

## Features:
- Detect deepfake content in images and videos
- Generate confidence scores for media
- Data augmentation for improved accuracy
- Interactive dashboard for analysis results

## Progress:
- CNN model trained and tested on image datasets
- Initial accuracy achieved, fine-tuning in progress
- Plans to extend functionality for videos and live streams
Deepfake Detection Tool

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a deepfake detection tool that aims to identify manipulated images and videos using AI-driven models. As the prevalence of deepfakes grows, this tool enhances digital media integrity by detecting potential tampering, ensuring the credibility of content, and combating misinformation.
Features

Image & Video Deepfake Detection: Analyze and detect fake content in common file formats (e.g., jpg, png, mp4, avi).
Confidence Score: Generate a confidence score indicating the likelihood of the media being a deepfake.
Suspicious Region Highlighting: Highlight regions of potential manipulation, such as facial landmarks.
Dashboard & Reports: Display results on an interactive dashboard and generate a summary report.
Secure Media Processing: Ensure data security and privacy during the analysis.
In-Scope and Out-of-Scope

In-Scope:
Detecting deepfakes in images and videos.
Out-of-Scope:
General fake news detection or text-based fake content analysis.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
Flask (for UI)
AWS SDK (optional for deployment)
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt


Installation
Clone the repository:
bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection-tool.git
cd deepfake-detection-tool


Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained models:
We use models based on the DeepFake Detection Challenge. You can place the downloaded model in the models directory.
Run the tool:bash python app.py


Access the tool by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.



Usage:
Media Upload
Upload an image or video file through the interface.
The tool processes the media and generates a confidence score for deepfake detection.
Real-Time Detection
Upload a video URL for real-time detection (feature in progress).
Analysis Output
The tool displays a score indicating the likelihood of the media being manipulated.
Suspicious regions in the media will be highlighted, and a downloadable report will be generated.
